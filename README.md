# SnakeCurses
A simple game of snake in C using the ncurses library.

## Dependencies
This game requires the ncurses library to run. If not installed, run `sudo apt-get install libncurses5` and try compiling.

## Compiling and running
You can compile this with your C compiler of choice (like gcc or tcc) with the option `-lncursesw`. This should compile the game properly, and you can run it with `./a.out`.

## How to play
You can move the snake with vi-style keys (h, j, k, l). Don't hit yourself, don't hit the walls, eat fruit to grow, and try to get as long as you can.
